Hi I'm Daniel from Blendle
---
Component Library? Why?
---
Why not?
---
So let‚Äôs talk about a day in the life of a front end developer
---
I like beautiful user interfaces ‚Ä¶
---
‚Ä¶ I love beautiful code ‚Ä¶
---
‚Ä¶ but my boss likes deadlines

Finding the balance between delivering state of the art UI interactions and shipping a feature as adequate as possible because it adds value to the business is one of the hardest tasks of a developer.
---
So yeah, we wanted to make that less painful
---
Designers ‚ù§Ô∏è Developers
---
1. Designs go in
2. Code comes out (React)
3. CSS gets parsed (CSS modules)
4. Components are tested (Unit tests)
5. A package gets generated (react-styleguidist)
---
About react-styleguidist
---
What do we like about it?
---
Now let‚Äôs dive into a component
---
Cool? It‚Äôs only half the story.
---
We were forced to use best practices in a natural way
---
About styles
---
Global styles are the enemy
---

---
So‚Ä¶ inline styles then?
---
[image of ugly DOM]
---
- syntax is ‚Äòmeh‚Äô at best
- hard to use with pseudo selectors
- hard to  use with media queries
- hard to use with animations
- no pre/post processing
- no caching of stylesheets
- and don‚Äôt forget about the designers
---
CSS modules it is
---
- It‚Äôs regular CSS
- You import CSS like a javascript file
- In JS it‚Äôs an object, where CSS classes are object properties
- Classnames are hashed in build, so never collide
- Global styles still possible when needed
- Use pre/post processors
---
What did we learn?
---
About testing
---
We don‚Äôt believe 100% test coverage is a great goal
---
And yet we test everything in the component library ‚Ä¶
---
Why?
---
As long as the unit tests pass, the clients using the component will keep working
---
How?
---
So‚Ä¶ no downsides?
---
Recap
---
It‚Äôs not about the tools we used, it‚Äôs about the lessons we learned
---
You told me you‚Äôd get the business rooting for a project like this.
---
It‚Äôs your responsibility as a developer
---
- Understand the needs of the business
- Explain how your fancy component library and testing habits benefit the business in the short term and (even more) in the long term.
- Understand when you have to make concessions and when you absolutely can not
- Always explain why you‚Äôre doing things
